   *
   * This was the closure passed to `perform`, bound to `this`. Converting it
   * to a `PendingEffect` handler first moved it to module scope, where `this`
   * is gone, and the registries became `…Instance` singletons — invisible in
   * the game, which uses the singletons, and wrong everywhere else. A method
   * keeps the original body — `this` read as `action` — and
   * `registerDelayedAction` hands the handler the action that was performed,
   * so this runs on that one.
   *
   * Static, because an instance method would not compile: a new public member
   * makes this class unassignable to `Action` (`DataObject._keys:
   * (keyof this)[]`), and it is passed as one to `MovementCost` and `Moved`.
   * A static method of the class may still read its instances' private
   * fields, and does not change `keyof this`.
